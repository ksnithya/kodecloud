The Nautilus production support team was trying to fix issues with their storage server. The storage server has a shared directory /webapp, 
which is mounted on all app servers at location /var/www/html so that whatever data they store on storage server under /webapp can be shared among all app servers. 
Somehow NFS server is broken and having some issues.


Identify the root cause of the issue and fix it to make sure sharing works fine among all app servers and storage server.





Modify /etc/exports
/webapp 172.16.238.11(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash,fsid=0)
/webapp 172.16.238.12(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash,fsid=0)
/webapp 172.16.238.10(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash,fsid=0)

systemctl restart nfs

on all app servers

mount ststor01:/webapp /var/www/html
