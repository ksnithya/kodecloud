For our infrastructure in Stratos Datacenter, we need to serve our website code from a common/shared location that can be shared among all app nodes. 
To solve this, we came up with a solution to use the NFS (Network File System) server where we can store the data and mount the share among our app nodes. 
The dedicated NFS server will be our storage server. To accomplish this task, perform the following steps:


Install required NFS packages on storage server.
yum install nfs-utils

Configure storage server to act as an NFS server.

Make a NFS share /webapp on storage server.
chmod -R 755 /webapp
chown nfsnobody:nfsnobody /webapp

systemctl enable rpcbind
systemctl enable nfs-server
systemctl enable nfs-lock
systemctl enable nfs-idmap
systemctl start rpcbind
systemctl start nfs-server
systemctl start nfs-lock
systemctl start nfs-idmap

vi /etc/exports
/webapp 172.16.238.10(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_all_squash)
/webapp 172.16.238.11(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_all_squash)
/webapp 172.16.238.12(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_all_squash)

systemctl restart nfs-server



Install and configure NFS client packages on all app nodes and configure them to act as NFS client.
On app servers:
yum install nfs-utils

Mount /webapp directory on all app nodes at /var/www/nfsdata directory (Create the directories if don't exist).

mount -t nfs 172.16.238.15:/webapp /var/www/nfsdata

Start and enable required services.
