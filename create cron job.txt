The Nautilus system admins team has prepared scripts to automate several day-to-day tasks. They want them to be deployed on all app servers in Stratos DC on a set schedule. Before that they need to test similar functionality with a sample cron job. Therefore, perform the steps below:


a. Install cronie package on all Nautilus app servers and start crond service.

b. Add a cron */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text for root user.

You have to do this in all server stapp01,stapp02, stapp03. I have showed only for stapp03 Step 1: At first login as a root user
ssh banner@stapp03
sudo su
Step 2: Install cronie in the server
yum install cronie -y
systemctl restart crond && systemctl status crond
Step 3: Create a cronjob by typing
crontab -e
Write the cron job:  */5 * * * * echo hello  >  /tmp/cron_text
Step 4: Check cron job
Check cron job: crontab -l
Check cron job for Root: crontab -u root -l

Login to all app server as root user

ex:
1. ssh tony@stapp01
sudo su -

2. yum install cronie -y - install cron 
3. systemctl restart crond - restart cron service
4. crontab -e  - command to edit crontab
*/5 * * * * echo hello  >  /tmp/cron_text

5. crontab -l - to list cron job
