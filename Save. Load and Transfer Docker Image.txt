One of the DevOps team members was working on to create a new custom docker image on App Server 1 in Stratos DC. He is done with his changes and image is saved on same server with name demo:devops. Recently a requirement has been raised by a team to use that image for testing, but the team wants to test the same on App Server 3. So we need to provide them that image on App Server 3 in Stratos DC.


a. On App Server 1 save the image demo:devops in an archive.

b. Transfer the image archive to App Server 3.
