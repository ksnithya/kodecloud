xFusionCorp Industries planning to host two static websites on their infra in Stratos Datacenter. The development of these websites 
is still in-progress but we want to get the servers ready. The storage server has a shared directory /data that is mounted on each app host under /var/www/html directory.
 Please perform below given steps to accomplish the task:


a. Install httpd package and dependencies on all app hosts.

ssh tony@stapp01
Ir0nM@n
yum install httpd -y
systemctl enable httpd
systemctl restart httpd
systemctl status httpd

ssh steve@stapp02
Am3ric@
yum install httpd -y
systemctl enable httpd
systemctl restart httpd
systemctl status httpd

ssh banner@stapp03
BigGr33n
yum install httpd -y
systemctl enable httpd
systemctl restart httpd
systemctl status httpd

b. Apache should serve on port 8080 within the apps.
vi  /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
Listen 8080

c. There are two website's backups /home/thor/official and /home/thor/media on jump_host. 
Setup them on Apache in a way that official should work on link http://<<lb-url>>/official/ and media should work on link http://<<lb-url>>/media. 
(do not worry about load balancer configuration, its already configured)

ssh natasha@ststor01
Bl@kW
cd /data
mkdir media
cd media
vi index.html

d. You can access the website on LBR link, to do so click on the + button on top of your terminal and select 
option Select port to view on Host 1 and after adding port 80 click on Display Port.
