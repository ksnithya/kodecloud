The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries needs to deploy a new application on App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. They have some pre-requites to get ready that server for application deployment. Prepare the server as per requirements shared below:


Install and configure nginx on App Server 1.
yum install epel-release
yum install nginx

[root@stapp01 ~]# systemctl enable nginx
Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/nginx.service to /usr/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service.
[root@stapp01 ~]# systemctl restart nginx
[root@stapp01 ~]# systemctl status nginx

On App Server 1 there is a self signed SSL certificate and key present at location /tmp/nautilus.crt and /tmp/nautilus.key. 
Move them to some appropriate location and deploy the same in Nginx.



Create an index.html file with content Welcome! under Nginx document root.
vi usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
Welcome!

For final testing try to access the App Server 1 link (either hostname or IP) from jump host using curl command. For example curl -Ik https://<app-server-ip>/.
