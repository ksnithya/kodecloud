After doing some security audits of servers, xFusionCorp Industries security team has implemented some new security policies. One of them is to disable direct root login through SSH.


Disable direct SSH root login on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter.
root@stapp01 ~]# vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PermitRootLogin no
[root@stapp01 ~]# systemctl restart sshd
[root@stapp01 ~]# systemctl status sshd
