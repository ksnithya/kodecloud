The Nautilus DevOps team wants to create a ReplicationController to deploy several pods. They are going to deploy applications on these pods, which need some highly available infrastructure. Below you can find exact details, and please create the ReplicationController accordingly.


Create a ReplicationController using httpd image, preferably with latest tag, and name it as httpd-replicationcontroller.

Labels app should be httpd_app, and labels type should be front-end. The container should be named as httpd-container and also make sure replica counts are 3.

All pods should be running state.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.





apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: httpd-replicationcontroller
  labels:
    app: httpd_app
    type: front-end

  replicas: 3

        image: httpd:latest

hor@jump_host /$ sudo vi replica.yml

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
