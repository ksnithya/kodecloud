A developer Siva has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. Being a temporary resource for this project we need a temporary user for Siva. Its a good idea to create a user with some auto expiry date so that user won't be able to access servers once expired.


So create a user named siva on the App server 2. Set expiry date to 2021-02-17 in Stratos Datacenter. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.

[root@stapp02 ~]# id siva
id: siva: no such user
[root@stapp02 ~]# useradd -e 2021-02-17 siva
[root@stapp02 ~]# id siva
uid=1002(siva) gid=1002(siva) groups=1002(siva)
[root@stapp02 ~]# chage -l siva
