The Nautilus DevOps team has started practicing some pods and services deployment on Kubernetes platform as 
they are planning to migrate most of their applications on Kubernetes platform. Recently one of the team members has been assigned a task to create a pod as per details mentioned below:


Create a pod named pod-httpd using the image httpd with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e httpd:latest.

Labels app should be named as httpd_app, also container should be named as httpd-container.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-httpd
  labels:
    app: httpd_app
spec:
  containers:
    - name: httpd-container
      image: httpd:latest

thor@jump_host /$ sudo vi pod.yml

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
