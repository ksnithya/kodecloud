The Nautilus DevOps team needs to set up several docker environments for different applications. One of the team members has been assigned a ticket where he has been asked to 
create some docker networks to be used later. Complete the task based on the following ticket description:


a. Create a docker network named as beta on App Server 2 in Stratos DC.

b. Configure it to use bridge drivers.

c. Set it to use subnet 192.168.0.0/24 and iprange 192.168.0.2/24.

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
