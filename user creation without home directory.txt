The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up a new tool on all app servers, as they have a requirement to create a service user account that will be used by that tool. They are finished with all apps except App 2 in Stratos Datacenter.


Create a user named yousuf in App Server 2 without a home directory.


 -M OR --no-create-home	do not create the userâ€™s home directory

[root@stapp02 ~]# useradd --no-create-home yousuf
